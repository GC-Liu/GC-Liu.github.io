\\Proposed a multi-hop user relation prediction framework based upon Graph Markov Neural Network (GMNN)
\\- Develop a deductive logic model (3VSL) for explainable trust relation prediction in social graph 
\\- Employ a graph neural network (GNN) based architecture to equivalently reconstruct 3VSL
\\- Reduce multi-hop trust prediction to an EM-based algorithm derived from GMNN
\\- Publish and submit \textbf{10} papers on top tier conferences and journals in network and security domain, including \textbf{IEEE TDSC}, \textbf{IEEE INFOCOM}, \textbf{IEEE CNS} and \textbf{IEEE TMM}, etc.
