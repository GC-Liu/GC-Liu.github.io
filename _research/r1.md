title: "Trust Modeling in Online Social Networks"
excerpt: "Proposed a multi-hop user relation prediction framework based upon Graph Markov Neural Network (GMNN)
- Develop a deductive logic model (3VSL) for explainable trust relation prediction in social graph 
- Employ a graph neural network (GNN) based architecture to equivalently reconstruct 3VSL
- Reduce multi-hop trust prediction to an EM-based algorithm derived from GMNN
