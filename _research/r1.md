title: "Trust Modeling in Online Social Networks"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/r1.png' width='400' height='240'><br/>
Proposed a multi-hop user relation prediction framework based upon Graph Markov Neural Network (GMNN) <br/>
- Develop a deductive logic model (3VSL) for explainable trust relation prediction in social graph  <br/>
- Employ a graph neural network (GNN) based architecture to equivalently reconstruct 3VSL <br/>
- Reduce multi-hop trust prediction to an EM-based algorithm derived from GMNN <br/>"
